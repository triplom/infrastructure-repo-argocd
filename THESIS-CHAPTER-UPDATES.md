## Chapter 3: Implementation of Pull-Based GitOps with ArgoCD App-of-Apps

### 3.1 Architecture Overview

The implemented solution demonstrates a comprehensive pull-based GitOps architecture using ArgoCD's app-of-apps pattern. This approach provides hierarchical application management, separating concerns between the control plane and application deployments.

#### 3.1.1 Repository Structure

The implementation consists of three main repositories:

1. **infrastructure-repo-argocd** (Control Plane)
   - ArgoCD application definitions
   - App-of-apps Helm charts
   - Project definitions and RBAC
   - CI/CD pipeline configuration

2. **infrastructure-repo** (Workload Definitions)
   - Application manifests (app1, app2)
   - Infrastructure components (cert-manager, ingress-nginx, monitoring)
   - Kustomize overlays for multi-environment support

3. **k8s-web-app-php** (Application Source)
   - PHP web application source code
   - Docker configuration
   - Application-specific CI/CD pipeline

#### 3.1.2 App-of-Apps Pattern Implementation

The app-of-apps pattern is implemented through four main components:

1. **Root Application** (`root-app/`)
   - Central orchestrator managing all app-of-apps
   - Helm chart structure for configuration management
   - Controls enabling/disabling of component groups

2. **Application Management** (`app-of-apps/`)
   - Manages application deployments (app1, app2)
   - Uses ApplicationSets for multi-environment deployment
   - Supports dev, qa, and prod environments

3. **Monitoring Stack** (`app-of-apps-monitoring/`)
   - Manages Prometheus and Grafana deployments
   - Centralized monitoring configuration
   - Environment-specific monitoring overlays

4. **Infrastructure Components** (`app-of-apps-infra/`)
   - Manages cert-manager for SSL certificate automation
   - Controls ingress-nginx for traffic routing
   - Handles monitoring infrastructure components

### 3.2 Technical Implementation Details

#### 3.2.1 Root Application Configuration

The root application serves as the entry point for the entire GitOps system:

```yaml
# Root Application Template (see Appendix A.1)
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: root-app
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  project: default
  source:
    repoURL: https://github.com/triplom/infrastructure-repo-argocd.git
    targetRevision: HEAD
    path: root-app
  destination:
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
    namespace: argocd
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: true
```

#### 3.2.2 Multi-Environment Support

The implementation provides comprehensive multi-environment support through:

1. **ApplicationSets**: Enable template-based application deployment across environments
2. **Kustomize Overlays**: Environment-specific configuration management
3. **Project-based RBAC**: Secure access control for different environments

Example ApplicationSet configuration (full code in Appendix A.2):

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ApplicationSet
metadata:
  name: app1
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  generators:
  - list:
      elements:
      - env: dev
      - env: qa  
      - env: prod
  template:
    metadata:
      name: 'app1-{{env}}'
    spec:
      source:
        repoURL: https://github.com/triplom/infrastructure-repo.git
        path: apps/app1/overlays/{{env}}
```

#### 3.2.3 Security and RBAC Implementation

The solution implements project-based security with three main projects:

1. **Applications Project**: Manages application deployments with restricted permissions
2. **Monitoring Project**: Controls monitoring stack with appropriate cluster-level access
3. **Infrastructure Project**: Manages infrastructure components with elevated permissions

### 3.3 CI/CD Pipeline Integration

#### 3.3.1 Pull-Based Pipeline Architecture

The CI/CD pipeline implements a true pull-based approach where:

1. **Source Code Changes**: Trigger builds in application repositories
2. **Image Updates**: Pipeline updates external infrastructure-repo with new image tags
3. **ArgoCD Detection**: Automatically detects changes and deploys applications
4. **Zero Direct Access**: No direct cluster access from CI/CD pipelines

#### 3.3.2 Pipeline Implementation

The simplified pipeline (complete code in Appendix A.3) focuses on:

```yaml
# Simplified CI/CD Pipeline
update-config:
  needs: build
  steps:
    - name: Update external infrastructure repository
      run: |
        git clone https://github.com/triplom/infrastructure-repo.git
        cd infrastructure-repo
        # Update image tags using kustomize
        kustomize edit set image app1=$IMAGE_TAG
        git commit -m "Update image to $IMAGE_TAG"
        git push origin main
```

### 3.4 Monitoring and Observability

#### 3.4.1 Comprehensive Monitoring Stack

The implementation includes a complete monitoring solution:

1. **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and alerting
2. **Grafana**: Visualization and dashboards
3. **Application Metrics**: Custom application monitoring
4. **ArgoCD Metrics**: GitOps operation monitoring

#### 3.4.2 GitOps Metrics

Key metrics tracked include:

- Application sync status and frequency
- Deployment success/failure rates
- Configuration drift detection
- Pipeline execution times
