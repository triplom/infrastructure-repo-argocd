# 🎯 READY FOR TESTING: GHCR_TOKEN Configuration Complete

## ✅ Current Status: Ready for CI/CD Pipeline Validation

**All prerequisites completed**:

- ✅ GHCR_TOKEN Personal Access Token created and configured
- ✅ CI pipeline updated to use PAT authentication  
- ✅ Setup workflow updated to use PAT authentication
- ✅ Latest changes pushed to GitHub repository
- ✅ Infrastructure fully deployed and operational

## 🧪 Testing Steps (Choose One)

### Option 1: Test GHCR Setup Workflow (Recommended First Test)

```bash
# This tests basic GHCR connectivity with a simple hello-world container
1. Go to: [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/triplom/infrastructure-repo-argocd/actions)
2. Click "Setup GitHub Container Registry" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" → "Run workflow" (use default branch: main)
4. Watch the workflow logs for success
```

**Expected Success Output**:

```bash
✅ Login to GHCR successful
✅ Docker build completes  
✅ Docker push to ghcr.io/triplom/app1:test succeeds
✅ No "permission_denied" errors
```

### Option 2: Test Main CI Pipeline

```bash
# This tests the full application build and deployment pipeline
1. Go to: [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/triplom/infrastructure-repo-argocd/actions)  
2. Click "CI Pipeline" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow" → Select environment (dev/test/prod) → "Run workflow"
4. Watch for successful build, test, and GHCR push
```

### Option 3: Re-run Previous Failed Workflow

```bash
# This retests the exact scenario that was failing
1. Go to: [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/triplom/infrastructure-repo-argocd/actions)
2. Find the failed "Setup GitHub Container Registry #2" run
3. Click "Re-run failed jobs"
4. Should now succeed with GHCR_TOKEN authentication
```

## 📊 Success Indicators to Watch For

### ✅ Workflow Success Signals

- **Green checkmark** instead of red X on workflow run
- **No "permission_denied"** errors in logs
- **"Successfully pushed"** message in Docker push step
- **Package creation** confirmation message

### ✅ Package Verification

- Visit: [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/triplom/packages)  
- Should see `app1` package listed
- Package shows recent timestamp
- Container shows proper tags (test, latest, etc.)

### ✅ Container Pull Test

```bash
# After successful push, test pulling the container
docker pull ghcr.io/triplom/app1:test
# Should download successfully without authentication errors
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting (If Still Failing)

### Check Secret Configuration

```bash
# Verify the secret exists (this won't show the value, just confirms it exists)
# Go to: [Repository Secrets](https://github.com/triplom/infrastructure-repo-argocd/settings/secrets/actions)
# Should see "GHCR_TOKEN" listed under Repository secrets
```

### Verify PAT Permissions

```bash
# Ensure your Personal Access Token has these scopes:
- ✅ write:packages
- ✅ read:packages  
- ✅ repo (if repository is private)
```

## 🚀 After Successful GHCR Test

### Validate Complete GitOps Workflow

1. **Test ArgoCD Sync**: Verify ArgoCD can pull new container images
2. **Test Image Updates**: Use the update-image.sh script to change app versions
3. **Validate Deployment**: Check that applications deploy with new images

### Test External Repository Integration

1. **Apply Same Fix**: Update external repos with GHCR_TOKEN method
2. **Test Cross-Repo**: Verify external applications can also push to GHCR
3. **Validate ApplicationSets**: Ensure external apps deploy via ArgoCD

## 📋 Current Infrastructure Status

```bash
# Quick status check of your environment
kubectl get namespaces | grep -E "(cert-manager|ingress|monitoring|argocd)"
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep -E "(cert-manager|ingress|monitoring)" | wc -l
kubectl get applications -n argocd | head -5
```

## 🎯 What This Resolves

**Primary Issue**: `denied: permission_denied: write_package` when pushing to GHCR
**Root Cause**: GitHub repository permissions insufficient for GITHUB_TOKEN
**Solution**: Personal Access Token with explicit package write permissions
**Expected Outcome**: Successful container builds and pushes to GitHub Container Registry

## ⚡ Quick Action

**RECOMMENDED**: Start with Option 1 (GHCR Setup Workflow test) as it's the simplest validation that the permission issue is resolved.

---

**Status**: 🟢 **READY FOR TESTING**  
**Confidence**: High - GHCR_TOKEN should resolve permission issues  
**Next**: Run workflow test and verify package creation
