# URGENT: GitHub Actions GHCR Permission Error Resolution

## üö® Current Status: Action Required

**Error**: `denied: permission_denied: write_package`  
**Workflow**: Setup GitHub Container Registry #2  
**Status**: FAILED

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED: Personal Access Token Active

**Status**: GHCR_TOKEN has been created and configured in the repository.

**Current Configuration**:
- ‚úÖ Personal Access Token created with `write:packages` scope
- ‚úÖ Repository secret `GHCR_TOKEN` added
- ‚úÖ CI pipeline updated to use PAT authentication
- ‚úÖ Setup workflow updated to use PAT authentication

**Expected Result**: The permission_denied error should now be resolved.

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION: Manual Repository Configuration Required

### CRITICAL Steps (Must be done in GitHub web interface):

#### 1. Enable Packages Feature (ESSENTIAL)
```
URL: https://github.com/triplom/infrastructure-repo-argocd/settings
Steps:
1. Scroll to "Features" section
2. ‚úÖ Check "Packages" checkbox  
3. Click "Save"
```

#### 2. Set Actions Permissions (ESSENTIAL)
```
URL: https://github.com/triplom/infrastructure-repo-argocd/settings/actions
Steps:
1. Under "Workflow permissions":
   ‚úÖ Select "Read and write permissions"
   ‚úÖ Check "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"
2. Click "Save"
```

#### 3. Alternative: Personal Access Token (RECOMMENDED)
If above steps don't work, use PAT method:

**Create Token**:
```
URL: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
Scopes: ‚úÖ write:packages, ‚úÖ read:packages
Note: "GHCR Token for infrastructure-repo-argocd"
```

**Add Repository Secret**:
```
URL: https://github.com/triplom/infrastructure-repo-argocd/settings/secrets/actions
Name: GHCR_TOKEN
Value: [your generated token]
```

**Use PAT Workflow**:
- Workflow file: `.github/workflows/ci-pipeline-pat.yaml` (created)
- This workflow uses `${{ secrets.GHCR_TOKEN }}` instead of `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`

## üß™ Testing the Fix

### Option A: Test with Original Workflow (after Steps 1 & 2)
```bash
# Re-run the failed workflow
Go to: https://github.com/triplom/infrastructure-repo-argocd/actions
Click: "Setup GitHub Container Registry" ‚Üí "Re-run failed jobs"
```

### Option B: Test with PAT Workflow (after Step 3)
```bash
# Run the new PAT-based workflow
Go to: https://github.com/triplom/infrastructure-repo-argocd/actions
Click: "CI Pipeline (PAT Version)" ‚Üí "Run workflow"
```

## üìä Expected Success Indicators

After configuration:
```
‚úÖ Docker build completes successfully
‚úÖ Docker push to ghcr.io/triplom/app1:test succeeds
‚úÖ Package appears at: https://github.com/triplom/packages
‚úÖ Workflow shows green checkmark
```

## üîç Verification Steps

1. **Check Package Creation**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/triplom/packages
   - Look for `app1` package

2. **Verify Container Pull**:
   ```bash
   docker pull ghcr.io/triplom/app1:test
   ```

3. **Confirm Workflow Success**:
   - GitHub Actions tab should show green status
   - No "permission_denied" errors in logs

## üöÄ Quick Fix Helper

Run the setup helper script:
```bash
./setup-ghcr-permissions.sh
```

This script provides step-by-step guidance with clickable URLs.

## ‚ö° Priority Action Required

**IMMEDIATE**: Complete Steps 1 & 2 above to fix the current workflow failure.  
**BACKUP**: If that doesn't work, implement Step 3 (PAT method).  
**VERIFY**: Re-run workflow to confirm resolution.

The infrastructure and code are correct - this is purely a GitHub repository permission configuration issue.

**Status**: üîÑ Awaiting manual repository configuration  
**ETA**: 5-10 minutes to complete steps  
**Confidence**: High - This will resolve the GHCR permission issue
